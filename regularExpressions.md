# Regular Expressions
* Regular expressions are used to find certain words or patterns inside of strings.

### Finding the word "the" in the string "The dog chased the cat"
    /the/gi

* / is the start of the regular expression.

* the is the pattern we want to match.

* / is the end of the regular expression.

* g means global, which causes the pattern to return all matches in the string, not just the first one.

* i means that we want to ignore the case (uppercase or lowercase) when searching for the pattern.
